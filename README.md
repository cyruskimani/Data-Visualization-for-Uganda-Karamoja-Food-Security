# Data-Visualization-for-Uganda-Karamoja-Food-Security.
Data Visualization developed by Dalberg Data Insights to assist NGOs working in Uganda Karamoja in decision making to improve food security in the area.

# Assessment

The visualization for this analysis was done in Tableau.

The Tableau workbook can be accessed here:https://public.tableau.com/profile/cyrus.kimani#!/vizhome/KaramojaDatasetAnalysis-Week1IPCyrusKimani/Districts

# VIsualization

A Tableau dashboard containing maps to present the dataset as analyzed.

The results have been visualized by district and by Sub-County which are the two administrative levels used by the NGOs.

# Resources

The dataset contains the following:

  1. Shapefiles Boundaries of Districts and Sub-Counties in Uganda Karamoja.

  2. Numerical data as .csv files detailing the production of maize and sorghum in the Districs and Sub-Counties.

# Overview

Karamoja (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karamoja) is a food-insecure region of Uganda whose low food productivity is caused by intense droughts as well as pest and disease outbreaks.

Several NGOs in Karamoja provide technical support and farm inputs to farmers in a bid to suppress the food insecurity problem. However, they lack visibility into the overall state of the region and often need to rely on some very local sources of information to prioritize their activities.

Dalberg Data Insights (DDI) has been requested to develop a new food security monitoring tool to support the decision making of one of those NGOs active in Karamoja.

To do so, Dalberg Data Insights developed a methodology to remotely measure the yield of the two main staple crops of the region (i.e. sorghum and maize) based on satellite images. The agri-tech team just ran the model for the 2017 crop season.
