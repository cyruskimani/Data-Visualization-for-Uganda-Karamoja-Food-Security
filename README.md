# Overview

Karamoja (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karamoja) is the most food-insecure region of Uganda. One of the main reasons is the low productivity level of the crops due to intense droughts as well as pest and disease outbreaks.

In Karamoja, several NGOs provide technical support as well as farm inputs to the farmers experiencing extremely low yield. Though, they lack visibility into the overall state of the region and often need to rely on some very local sources of information to prioritize their activities.

Dalberg Data Insights (DDI) has been requested to develop a new food security monitoring tool to support the decision making of one of those NGOs active in Karamoja.

To do so, Dalberg Data Insights developed a methodology to remotely measure the yield of the two main staple crops of the region (i.e. sorghum and maize) based on satellite images. The agri-tech team just ran the model for the 2017 crop season.
